# IP Command Cheat Sheet for Addressing and Routing

## ðŸ“Œ Addressing
```bash
ip address show                              # Show all IP addresses
ip address show eth0                         # Show IP addresses of eth0 
ip address show up                           # Show IPs of those interfaces that are up
ip address show dynamic|permanent            # Show dynamic or static
ip address add 10.0.1.20/24 dev eth0         # Add a new IP 10.0.1.20 to eth0
ip address add 10.0.1.20/24 dev eth0 label eth0:Interface1   # Add IP and label it
ip address delete 10.0.1.20/24 dev eth0      # Delete the address from interface
ip address flush dev eth0                    # Delete all IPs from an interface




## ðŸ“Œ Routing

ip route [show]                              # Show the routing table (IPv4 + IPv6)
ip -6 route                                  # Show only IPv6 routes
ip -4 route                                  # Show only IPv4 routes
ip route show root 10.0.1.10/24              # Show more specific routes (supernet)
ip route show match 10.0.1.10/24             # Show routes to this and larger nets
ip route show exact 10.0.1.10/24             # Show routes to EXACT network only
ip route get 10.0.1.10/24                    # Simulate resolving of a route in real time

# Add/Delete Routes
ip route add 10.0.1.10/24 via 10.13.77.1     # Add new route via next hop
ip route add 10.0.1.10/24 dev eth0           # Add new route via interface
ip route delete 10.0.1.10/24 via 10.13.77.1  # Delete specific route
ip route delete 10.0.1.10/24                 # Delete specific route

# Modify Routes
ip route change 10.0.1.10/24 dev eth0        # Change params of existing route
ip route replace 10.0.1.10/24 dev eth0       # Replace if exists, add if not

# Default Routes
ip route add default via 10.10.10.1          # Add default route via next hop
ip route add default dev eth0                # Add default route via interface
ip route add 0.0.0.0/0 dev eth0              # Add default route via interface
ip route delete default dev eth0             # Delete default route
ip -6 route add default via 2001:db8         # Add IPv6 default route

# Special Routes
ip route add blackhole 10.0.5.10             # Blackhole a route
ip route add unreachable 10.10.10.0/24       # Block route (Host unreachable)
ip route add prohibit 10.1.1.1/32            # Block route (ICMP administratively prohibited)
ip route add throw 10.1.1.1/32               # Block route (Net unreachable)

# Custom Metrics / Weights
ip route add 10.10.10.0/24 via 10.1.1.1 metric 5   # Add route with custom metric
ip route add default nexthop via 10.10.10.1 weight 1 nexthop dev ens33 weight 10  # Default route with custom weights
